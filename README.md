âš¡ Vandal is an in-development, library independent, menu framework written in C++17, currently only coming with direct rendering support for DX9.

# Ideals
- Vandal aims to be an easy to use and implement, performant high level menu framework meant to give users an intuitive and enjoyable experience,
- Vandal also is written to be independent to any library but the STL and render dependencies, often asking for literals to not lead to future usage,
- Vandal is also meant to be a library that's easy to learn from, and easy to contribute to, thus the motivation for the immediate mode idea, making it easy to sort render order, and also making it easy to implement features that'd be problematic on a retained mode scope, such as state-based dependencies.

# Direct development toolchain
The toolchain used by the Vandal creator, where code is tested and reviewed is as follows:
- MSVC Compiler (x86, Language Standard: std:++latest / std::c++17)
- Visual Studio 2019 IDE

# Contribution Guidelines
We require that, before making pull requests to Vandal, you:
- Adapt your code to the given clang-format settings,
- Adapt your code to the advised code style (read below),
- Test your code to see if there will be any issues in usage,
- Comment your code to be IntelliSense compatible.

[(For the latter you can use Visual Studio extensions such as CppTripleSlash).](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tcbhat.CppTripleSlash-xmldoccommentsforc)

# Code Style
Vandal is written in Pascal Case to make it easy to find and read functions by their name. Vandal doesn't make use of Hungarian Notation, or stuff alike, it is only meant to be intuitive.
